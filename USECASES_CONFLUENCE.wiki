h1. 1. Vision & Problem Statement

h2. Vision

A single, unified dashboard that gives every stakeholder — from developers to VPs — real-time visibility into deployment health, test quality, and release velocity across all cluster-regions and services.

h2. Problems We Solve

||Problem||Impact Today||Dashboard Solution||
|*No single source of truth* for deployment status|Teams check 4-5 different tools (ArgoCD, Jenkins, GitHub, Slack, spreadsheets) to understand what's deployed where|Unified view across all clusters and services|
|*Failures discovered too late*|Failed deployments or test regressions sit unnoticed for hours|Real-time health status with attention badges and alerts|
|*No historical trend visibility*|Can't answer "are we deploying faster or slower than last month?"|Time series analytics for build frequency, pass rates, lead time|
|*Rollback decisions are slow*|Engineers scramble to find which version was last stable|Instant visibility into rollback history and last-known-good version|
|*Cross-cluster blind spots*|Promotions between dev → staging → prod are tracked manually|Pipeline view showing promotion status across cluster-regions|
|*Test quality is opaque*|No easy way to see test pass rates trending over time per service|Test result badges + analytics charts per service per cluster|
|*Release reporting is manual*|Weekly status reports require pulling data from multiple sources|Dashboard replaces manual reporting with live data|

h1. 5. Recommended Additions

{tip:title=About this section}
These are capabilities *not in the current PoC* that are recommended based on industry best practices and common deployment dashboard needs.
{tip}

h2. 5.1 DORA Metrics Dashboard

{panel:title=DORA Metrics Dashboard|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#0052CC|bgColor=#DEEBFF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Yellow|title=P1}

*What:* Dedicated page showing the four DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics:

||Metric||Description||Data Source||
|*Deployment Frequency*|How often each service deploys to production|Deployment attempts (prod cluster)|
|*Lead Time for Changes*|Time from code commit to production deploy|Git SHA timestamp → prod deploy timestamp|
|*Change Failure Rate*|% of deployments that cause failures or rollbacks|Failed + Rollback / Total attempts|
|*Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)*|How quickly failures are resolved (rollback or fix deployed)|Time between failure and next success|

*Why:* DORA metrics are the industry standard for measuring DevOps performance. They provide leadership with a well-understood framework.
{panel}

h2. 5.2 Service Health Score Card

{panel:title=Service Health Score Card|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* A composite health score (0-100) per service based on weighted factors:

||Factor||Weight||Measurement||
|Latest build status|30%|SUCCESS = 100, ROLLBACK = 40, FAILED = 0|
|Test pass rate (7-day avg)|25%|Percentage across all suites|
|Deployment frequency|15%|Compared to team average|
|Rollback rate (30-day)|15%|Inverse of rollback %|
|Build lead time|15%|Compared to team average|

*Why:* Gives a single number that managers can use to identify services that need attention, without deep-diving into charts.
{panel}

h2. 5.3 Change Log / Activity Feed

{panel:title=Change Log / Activity Feed|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#0052CC|bgColor=#DEEBFF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Yellow|title=P1}

*What:* A real-time activity feed showing recent events across the platform:

{noformat}
10:42 AM  ✅  authn v3.4.3 deployed to mira-us-west-2 (SUCCESS, 14m)
10:38 AM  ❌  authz v2.1.0 failed in pavo-us-west-2 (FUNCTIONAL tests: 3 failures)
10:15 AM  🔄  account-mgmt v5.2.1 rolled back in aquila-us-east-2
09:50 AM  🚀  authn v3.4.3 promoted from mira → pavo
{noformat}

*Why:* Gives a chronological view of "what just happened" — essential during incidents or active release windows. Eliminates need to monitor Slack channels.
{panel}

h2. 5.4 Service Dependency Map

{panel:title=Service Dependency Map|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554C0|bgColor=#EAE6FF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Blue|title=P3}

*What:* Visual graph showing service-to-service dependencies. When a service fails, highlight downstream services that may be impacted.

*Why:* Deployment failures often cascade. If {{authn}} fails, every service depending on it is at risk. Visualizing this helps prioritize incident response.
{panel}

h2. 5.5 Deployment Comparison View

{panel:title=Deployment Comparison View|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#0052CC|bgColor=#DEEBFF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Yellow|title=P1}

*What:* Side-by-side comparison of a service's deployment across cluster-regions:

||Service||mira-us-west-2||pavo-us-west-2||aquila-us-east-2||
|authn|v3.4.3 {status:colour=Green|title=SUCCESS}|v3.4.2 {status:colour=Green|title=SUCCESS}|v3.4.1 {status:colour=Green|title=SUCCESS}|
|authz|v2.1.0 {status:colour=Red|title=FAILED}|v2.0.9 {status:colour=Green|title=SUCCESS}|v2.0.9 {status:colour=Green|title=SUCCESS}|

*Why:* Instantly see version drift across environments. Identify services that are behind in promotion or have inconsistent state.
{panel}

h2. 5.6 Scheduled Release Windows & Freeze Tracking

{panel:title=Release Windows & Freeze Tracking|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554C0|bgColor=#EAE6FF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Blue|title=P3}

*What:* Calendar view showing:
* Upcoming release windows
* Active deployment freezes (no deploys allowed)
* Planned promotions

*Why:* Critical for regulated environments. Prevents unauthorized deployments during freeze periods. Gives leadership visibility into release cadence.
{panel}

h2. 5.7 Team / Ownership Mapping

{panel:title=Team / Ownership Mapping|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Each service is tagged with an owning team. Dashboard supports:
* Filter by team (show only my team's services)
* Team-level health summary
* Team-level DORA metrics

*Why:* In organizations with 50+ services, every engineer cares most about their own team's services. Team filtering reduces noise and enables team-level accountability.
{panel}

h2. 5.8 SLA / SLO Tracking

{panel:title=SLA / SLO Tracking|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Define SLOs for deployment metrics and track compliance:

||SLO||Target||Current||Status||
|Deployment success rate|≥ 95%|97.2%|{status:colour=Green|title=MET}|
|Test pass rate (functional)|≥ 99%|99.8%|{status:colour=Green|title=MET}|
|Mean lead time|≤ 20 min|14.2 min|{status:colour=Green|title=MET}|
|Rollback rate|≤ 5%|3.1%|{status:colour=Green|title=MET}|
|MTTR|≤ 30 min|22 min|{status:colour=Green|title=MET}|

*Why:* Turns the dashboard from a monitoring tool into a *governance tool*. Teams can set targets and track progress. Leadership can measure CI/CD maturity.
{panel}

h2. 5.9 Flaky Test Detection

{panel:title=Flaky Test Detection|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Automatically detect tests that flip between pass and fail across recent builds:
* Flag tests that failed in build N, passed in build N+1, failed in build N+2
* Surface the top 10 flakiest tests per service
* Track flaky test count over time

*Why:* Flaky tests erode confidence in the CI/CD pipeline. Teams start ignoring failures because "it's probably flaky." Detecting and surfacing flaky tests is essential for maintaining pipeline trust.
{panel}

h2. 5.10 Deployment Approval Workflow

{panel:title=Deployment Approval Workflow|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554C0|bgColor=#EAE6FF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Blue|title=P3}

*What:* For production deployments, support:
* Required approvals before promotion
* Approval status visible on dashboard (pending / approved / rejected)
* Audit trail of who approved what

*Why:* Adds governance for production deployments without leaving the dashboard. Reduces reliance on Slack-based approvals.
{panel}

h2. 5.11 Cost-per-Deploy Tracking

{panel:title=Cost-per-Deploy Tracking|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554C0|bgColor=#EAE6FF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Blue|title=P3}

*What:* Track the CI/CD infrastructure cost per deployment:
* Build compute cost (GitHub Actions minutes, Jenkins agent time)
* Test execution cost (test infrastructure, cluster usage)
* Trend over time

*Why:* As deployment frequency increases, CI/CD costs can grow silently. Tracking cost-per-deploy helps optimize pipeline efficiency.
{panel}

h2. 5.12 Canary / Progressive Deployment Tracking

{panel:title=Canary / Progressive Deployment Tracking|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554C0|bgColor=#EAE6FF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Blue|title=P3}

*What:* For services using canary or blue-green deployments:
* Show canary percentage (e.g., "10% traffic → v3.4.3")
* Show canary health metrics (error rate, latency)
* Show promotion decision (auto-promote / manual / rollback)

*Why:* Modern deployment strategies go beyond "deploy and done." Tracking canary progress gives visibility into the full rollout lifecycle.
{panel}

h2. 5.13 Integration with Incident Management

{panel:title=Incident Management Integration|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Bi-directional integration with incident tools (PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Jira):
* When a deployment fails, auto-create an incident ticket
* Show active incidents on the dashboard alongside failed deploys
* Link from dashboard to incident timeline

*Why:* Closes the loop between "deployment failed" and "incident resolved." Enables MTTR tracking as a DORA metric.
{panel}

h2. 5.14 Custom Dashboard Views / Saved Filters

{panel:title=Custom Dashboard Views / Saved Filters|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Let users create and save custom views:
* "My Services" — only services my team owns
* "Production Only" — only production cluster-regions
* "Failing Now" — only services with failed latest builds

*Why:* Different personas need different views. Saved filters reduce time-to-insight for daily use.
{panel}

h2. 5.15 API Health Correlation

{panel:title=API Health Correlation|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#00875A|bgColor=#E3FCEF}
*Priority:* {status:colour=Green|title=P2}

*What:* Overlay production API health metrics (error rates, latency, availability) alongside deployment events:
* "AuthN deployed v3.4.3 at 10:42 AM → error rate spiked at 10:45 AM"
* Correlate deployment events with production impact

*Why:* The ultimate question after any deployment is "did it break anything?" Correlating deploy events with production metrics answers this instantly.
